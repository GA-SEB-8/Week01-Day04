**Learning Objective:** By the end of this lesson, the student will be able to implement nested functions to create helper functions that simplify complex tasks within a main function.

We can define functions within functions!

Why would we want to do this? An outer function may need a helper function relevant only to a given function. It would be good programming practice to hide that function from the rest of the program by nesting it within the function that needs it.

For example (no need to execute this):

```javascript
const title = 'This is the title of my cool book';

const toTitleCase = (string) =>{
  const capitalize = (word) => {
    return word.slice(0,1).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1);
  }

  let strArr = string.split(' ');
  strArr.forEach((el, i) => strArr[i] = capitalize(el));
  return strArr.join(' ');
}

toTitleCase(title); // This Is The Title Of My Cool Book
```
