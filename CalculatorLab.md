# Homework: JavaScript Calculator App

## Objective  

Create a simple **calculator app** using JavaScript that runs in the browser. This calculator will take user input via `prompt()` and display results using `alert()`. The goal is to practice working with **variables, user input, operators, and control flow**.

## Requirements  

1. The app should ask the user to **input two numbers**.
2. The app should then ask the user to **choose an operation** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Perform the selected operation on the numbers.
4. Display the result using `alert()`.
5. If the user enters invalid input (e.g., a non-number), display an error message.
6. The app should run inside a web browser (using an HTML file with a `<script>` tag).

## Example Usage  

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Choose an operation (+, -, *, /):*
Result: 10 * 5 = 50

## Bonus Challenges

- Prevent division by zero and show an appropriate error message.  
- Improve user experience with meaningful error handling and messages.
- Allow users the option to get the exponent of a number (you might need to google this)
- Allow users to find the Square Root of a number (this will be a control flow challenge as it will only require a single number input)
